# Server side rendered react app

This app demonstrates a simple server rendered react application. An easy way to verify this is to run the app, right click on the page and view source. You should see rendered HTML, where on a client side rendered react app you would only see a div to mount in to.

## Instructions
* npm install
* npm run dev
